# Conductor Java SDK v4

[Conductor](https://www.conductor-oss.org/) is the leading open-source orchestration platform allowing developers to build highly scalable distributed applications.

This Gradle project includes multiple modules that enable developers to manage, create, test, and run workflows and execute workers.

## Projects

The Conductor Java SDK v4 is organized into several key modules to help developers build and manage workflows and workers with ease

- **[conductor-client](conductor-client/README.md)**: This module provides the core client library to interact with Conductor through its HTTP API, enabling the creation, execution, and management of workflows, while also providing a framework for building workers.

- **[conductor-client-metrics](conductor-client-metrics/README.md)**: (Incubating) Provides metrics and monitoring capabilities for Conductor clients. 

- **[conductor-client-spring](conductor-client-spring/README.md)**: Provides Spring framework configurations, simplifying the use of Conductor client in Spring-based applications.

- **[examples](examples/README.md)**: Samples demonstrating how to use the Conductor Java SDK to create and manage workflows, tasks, and workers. These examples provide practical starting points for developers integrating Conductor into their applications.

- **[sdk](sdk/README.md)**: The SDK module allows developers to create, test and execute workflows using code.

- **orkes-client**: Extends the Conductor client by adding authentication needed for Orkes Conductor, and includes additional clients for interacting with endpoints specific to the Orkes-hosted Conductor platform.

- **orkes-spring**: Provides Spring framework configurations, simplifying the use of Orkes Conductor client in Spring-based applications.
