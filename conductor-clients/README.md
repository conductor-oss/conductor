# Conductor Clients

This directory serves as the central repository for various officially supported Conductor client projects.

> **Note (2024-09-17):** 
> 
> Currently, it only contains the incubating Java client/SDK v3.
> 
> We are in the process of refactoring our clients/SDKs (see: [conductor-sdk](https://github.com/conductor-sdk)) and will be moving them here soon.
