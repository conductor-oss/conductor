Provide visibility and traceability into these process flows. Simple interface to connect workers, which execute the tasks in workflows. Full operational control over workflows with the ability to pause, resume, restart, retry and terminate. Allow greater reuse of existing microservices providing an easier path for onboarding. User interface to visualize, replay and search the process flows. Ability to scale to millions of concurrently running process flows. Backed by a queuing service abstracted from the clients. Be able to operate on HTTP or other transports e.g. gRPC. Event handlers to control workflows via external actions. Client implementations in Java, Python and other languages. Various configurable properties with sensible defaults to fine tune workflow and task executions like rate limiting, concurrent execution limits etc. Why not peer to peer choreography?

Client libraries in other languages need to be modified to enable this. Contributions are welcomed. Context \u00b6 Conductor can be configured to enforce barriers on the size of workflow and task payloads for both input and output. These barriers can be used as safeguards to prevent the usage of conductor as a data persistence system and to reduce the pressure on its datastore. Barriers \u00b6 Conductor typically applies two kinds of barriers: Soft Barrier Hard Barrier Soft Barrier \u00b6 The soft barrier is used to alleviate pressure on the conductor datastore. In some special workflow use-cases, the size of the payload is warranted enough to be stored as part of the workflow execution. In such cases, conductor externalizes the storage of such payloads to S3 and uploads/downloads to/from S3 as needed during the execution. This process is completely transparent to the user/worker process. Hard Barrier \u00b6 The hard barriers are enforced to safeguard the conductor backend from the pressure of having to persist and deal with voluminous data which is not essential for workflow execution. In such cases, conductor will reject such payloads and will terminate/fail the workflow execution with the reasonForIncompletion set to an appropriate error message detailing the payload size. Usage \u00b6 Barriers setup \u00b6 Set the following properties to the desired values in the JVM system properties: Property Description default value conductor.workflow.input.payload.threshold.kb Soft barrier for workflow input payload in KB 5120 conductor.max.workflow.input.payload.threshold.kb Hard barrier for workflow input payload in KB 10240 conductor.workflow.output.payload.threshold.kb Soft barrier for workflow output payload in KB 5120 conductor.max.workflow.output.payload.threshold.kb Hard barrier for workflow output payload in KB 10240 conductor.task.input.payload.threshold.kb Soft barrier for task input payload in KB 3072 conductor.max.task.input.payload.threshold.kb Hard barrier for task input payload in KB 10240 conductor.task.output.payload.threshold.kb Soft barrier for task output payload in KB 3072 conductor.max.task.output.payload.threshold.kb Hard barrier for task output payload in KB 10240 Amazon S3 \u00b6 Conductor provides an implementation of Amazon S3 used to externalize large payload storage. Set the following property in the JVM system properties: workflow.external.payload.storage=S3 Note This implementation assumes that S3 access is configured on the instance. Set the following properties to the desired values in the JVM system properties: Property Description default value workflow.external.payload.storage.s3.bucket S3 bucket where the payloads will be stored workflow.external.payload.storage.s3.signedurlexpirationseconds The expiration time in seconds of the signed url for the payload 5 The payloads will be stored in the bucket configured above in a UUID.json file at locations determined by the type of the payload. See here for information about how the object key is determined. Azure Blob Storage \u00b6 ProductLive provides an implementation of Azure Blob Storage used to externalize large payload storage. To build conductor with azure blob feature read the README.md in azureblob-storage module Note This implementation assumes that you have an Azure Blob Storage account's connection string or SAS Token .

Another valuable addition is an idiomatic Go gRPC client implementation for the worker API. The proto models are auto-generated at compile time using this ProtoGen library. This custom library adds messageInput and messageOutput fields to all proto tasks and task definitions. The goal of these fields is providing a type-safe way to pass input and input metadata through tasks that use the gRPC API. These fields use the Any protobuf type which can store any arbitrary message type in a type-safe way, without the server needing to know the exact serialization format of the message. In order to expose these Any objects in the REST API, a custom encoding is used that contains the raw data of the serialized message by converting it into a dictionary with '@type' and '@value' keys, where '@type' is identical to the canonical representation and '@value' contains a base64 encoded string with the binary data of the serialized message. The JsonMapperProvider provides the object mapper initialized with this module to enable serialization/deserialization of these JSON objects. Cassandra Persistence \u00b6 The Cassandra persistence layer currently provides a partial implementation of the ExecutionDAO that supports all the CRUD operations for tasks and workflow execution. The data modelling is done in a denormalized manner and stored in two tables. The \u201cworkflows\u201d table houses all the information for a workflow execution including all its tasks and is the source of truth for all the information regarding a workflow and its tasks. The \u201ctask_lookup\u201d table, as the name suggests stores a lookup of taskIds to workflowId. This table facilitates the fast retrieval of task data given a taskId. All the datastore operations that are used during the critical execution path of a workflow have been implemented currently. Few of the operational abilities of the ExecutionDAO are yet to be implemented. This module also does not provide implementations for QueueDAO and MetadataDAO. We envision using the Cassandra DAO with an external queue implementation, since implementing a queuing recipe on top of Cassandra is an anti-pattern that we want to stay away from. External Payload Storage \u00b6 The implementation of this feature is such that the externalization of payloads is fully transparent and automated to the user. Conductor operators can configure the usage of this feature and is completely abstracted and hidden from the user, thereby allowing the operators full control over the barrier limits. Currently, only AWS S3 is supported as a storage system, however, as with all other Conductor components, this is pluggable and can be extended to enable any other object store to be used as an external payload storage system. The externalization of payloads is enforced using two kinds of barriers . Soft barriers are used when the payload size is warranted enough to be stored as part of workflow execution. These payloads will be stored in external storage and used during execution. Hard barriers are enforced to safeguard against voluminous data, and such payloads are rejected and the workflow execution is failed. The payload size is evaluated in the client before being sent over the wire to the server. If the payload size exceeds the configured soft limit, the client makes a request to the server for the location at which the payload is to be stored. In this case where S3 is being used, the server returns a signed url for the location and the client uploads the payload using this signed url. The relative path to the payload object is then stored in the workflow/task metadata. The server can then download this payload from this path and use as needed during execution. This allows the server to control access to the S3 bucket, thereby making the user applications where the worker processes are run completely agnostic of the permissions needed to access this location. Dynamic Workflow Executions \u00b6 In the earlier version (v1.x), Conductor allowed the execution of workflows referencing the workflow and task definitions stored as metadata in the system. This meant that a workflow execution with 10 custom tasks to run entailed: Registration of the 10 task definitions if they don't exist (assuming workflow task type SIMPLE for simplicity) Registration of the workflow definition Each time a definition needs to be retrieved, a call to the metadata store needed to be performed In addition to that, the system allowed current metadata that is in use to be altered, leading to possible inconsistencies/race conditions To eliminate these pain points, the execution was changed such that the workflow definition is embedded within the workflow execution and the task definitions are themselves embedded within this workflow definition. This enables the concept of ephemeral/dynamic workflows and tasks. Instead of fetching metadata definitions throughout the execution, the definitions are fetched and embedded into the execution at the start of the workflow execution. This also enabled the StartWorkflowRequest to be extended to provide the complete workflow definition that will be used during execution, thus removing the need for pre-registration. The MetadataMapperService prefetches the workflow and task definitions and embeds these within the workflow data, if not provided in the StartWorkflowRequest. Following benefits are seen as a result of these changes: Grants immutability of the definition stored within the execution data against modifications to the metadata store Better testability of workflows with faster experimental changes to definitions Reduced stress on the datastore due to prefetching the metadata only once at the start Decoupling Elasticsearch from Persistence \u00b6 In the earlier version (1.x), the indexing logic was imbibed within the persistence layer, thus creating a tight coupling between the primary datastore and the indexing engine. This meant that the primary datastore determines how we orchestrate between the storage (redis, mysql, etc) and the indexer(elastic search). The main disadvantage of this approach is the lack of flexibility, that is, we cannot run an in-memory database and external elastic search or vice-versa. We plan to improve this further by removing the indexing from the critical path of workflow execution, thus reducing possible points of failure during execution. Elasticsearch 5/6 Support \u00b6 Indexing workflow execution is one of the primary features of Conductor. This enables archival of terminal state workflows from the primary data store, along with providing a clean search capability from the UI. In Conductor 1.x, we supported both versions 2 and 5 of Elasticsearch by shadowing version 5 and all its dependencies. This proved to be rather tedious increasing build times by over 10 minutes. In Conductor 2.x, we have removed active support for ES 2.x, because of valuable community contributions for elasticsearch 5 and elasticsearch 6 modules. Unlike Conductor 1.x, Conductor 2.x supports elasticsearch 5 by default, which can easily be replaced with version 6 by following the simple instructions here . Maintaining workflow consistency with distributed locking and fencing tokens \u00b6 Problem \u00b6 Conductor\u2019s Workflow decide is the core logic which recursively evaluates the state of the workflow, schedules tasks, persists workflow and task(s) state at several checkpoints, and progresses the workflow. In a multi-node Conductor server deployment, the decide on a workflow can be triggered concurrently. For example, the worker can update Conductor server with latest task state, which calls decide, while the sweeper service (which periodically evaluates the workflow state to progress from task timeouts) would also call the decide on a different instance. The decide can be run concurrently in two different jvm nodes with two different workflow states, and based on the workflow configuration and current state, the result could be inconsistent. A two-part solution to maintain Workflow Consistency \u00b6 Preventing concurrent decides with distributed locking: The goal is to allow only one decide to run on a workflow at any given time across the whole Conductor Server cluster. This can be achieved by plugging in distributed locking implementations like Zookeeper, Redlock etc. A Zookeeper module implementing Conductor\u2019s Locking service is provided. Preventing stale data updates with fencing tokens: While the locking service helps to run one decide at a time, it might still be possible for nodes with timed out locks to reactivate and continue execution from where it left off (usually with stale data). This can be avoided with fencing tokens, which basically is an incrementing counter on workflow state with read-before-write support in a transaction or similar construct. At Netflix, we use Cassandra. Considering the tradeoffs of Cassandra\u2019s Lightweight Transactions (LWT) and the probability of this stale updates happening, and our testing results, we\u2019ve decided to first only rollout distributed locking with Zookeeper. We'll monitor our system and add C LWT if needed. Setting up desired level of consistency \u00b6 Based on your requirements, it is possible to use none, one or both of the distributed locking and fencing tokens implementations. Alternative solution to distributed \"decide\" evaluation \u00b6 As mentioned in the previous section, the \"decide\" logic is triggered from multiple places in a conductor instance. Either a direct trigger such as user starting a workflow or a timed trigger from the Sweeper service. Sweeper service is responsible for continually checking state of all workflows executions and trigger the \"decide\" logic which in turn can time the workflow out. In a single node deployment (single dynomite rack and single conductor server) this shouldn't be a problem. But when running multiple replicated dynomite racks and a conductor server on top of each rack, this might trigger the race condition described in previous section. Dynomite rack is a single or multiple instance dynomite setup that holds all the data. More on dynomite HA setup: (https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dynomite-making-non-distributed-databases-distributed-c7bce3d89404) In a cluster deployment, the default behavior for Dyno Queues is such, that it distributes the workload (round-robin style) to all the conductor servers. This can create a situation where the first task to be executed is queued for conductor server #1 but the sweeper service is queued for conductor server #2. More on dyno queues \u00b6 Dyno queues are the default queuing mechanism of conductor. Queues are allocated and used for: * Task execution - each task type gets a queue * Workflow execution - single queue with all currently executing workflows (deciderQueue) * This queue is used by SweeperService Each conductor server instance gets its own set of queues . Or more precisely a queue shard of its own. This means that if you have 2 task types, you end up with 6 queues altogether e.g. conductor_queues.test.QUEUE._deciderQueue.c conductor_queues.test.QUEUE._deciderQueue.d conductor_queues.test.QUEUE.HTTP.c conductor_queues.test.QUEUE.HTTP.d conductor_queues.test.QUEUE.LAMBDA.c conductor_queues.test.QUEUE.LAMBDA.d The \"c\" and \"d\" suffixes are the shards identifying conductor server instace #1 and instance #2 respectively. The shard names are extracted from dynomite rack name such as us-east-1c that is set in \"LOCAL_RACK\" or \"EC2_AVAILABILTY_ZONE\" Considering an execution of a simple workflow with just 2 tasks: [HTTP, LAMBDA], you should end up with queues being filled as follows: Workflow execution -> conductor_queues.test.QUEUE._deciderQueue.c HTTP taks execution -> conductor_queues.test.QUEUE.HTTP.d LAMBDA task execution -> conductor_queues.test.QUEUE.LAMBDA.c Which means that SweeperService in conductor instance #1 is responsible for sweeping the workflow, conductor #2 is responsible for executing HTTP task and conductor #1 again responsible for executing LAMBDA task. This illustrates the race condition: If the HTTP task completion in instance #2 happens at the same time as sweep in instance #1 ... you can end up with 2 different updates to a workflow execution: one update timing workflow out while the other completing the task and scheduling next. The round-robin strategy responsible for work distribution is defined here Back to alternative solution \u00b6 The alternative solution here is Switching round-robin queue allocation for a local-only strategy . Meaning that a workflow and its task executions are queued only for the conductor instance which started the workflow. This completely avoids the race condition for the price of removing task execution distribution. Since all tasks and the sweeper service read/write only from/to \"local\" queues, it is impossible to run into a race condition between conductor instances. The downside here is that the workload is not distributed across all conductor servers. Which might be an advantage in active-standby deployments. Considering other downsides ... Considering a situation where a conductor instance goes down: * With local-only strategy, the workflow executions from failed conductor instance will not progress until: * The conductor instance is restarted or * The executions are manually terminated and restarted from a different node * With round-robin strategy, there is a chance the tasks will be rescheduled on a different conductor node * This is nondeterministic though Enabling local only queue allocation strategy for dyno queues: Just enable following setting the config.properties: workflow.dyno.queue.sharding.strategy=localOnly The default is roundRobin","title":"Technical Details"},{"location":"technicaldetails/#grpc-framework","text":"As part of this addition, all of the modules and bootstrap code within them were refactored to leverage providers, which facilitated moving the Jetty server into a separate module and the conformance to Guice guidelines and best practices.

The switch expression, however, is simply an input parameter ( value-param evaluator) or a complex javascript expression ( javascript evaluator). Only two evaluators are supported by default in conductor. For Conductor Developers : Custom evaluators can be implemented without having to change the way SWITCH task works. To implement and use the custom evaluators we can use the params evaluatorType and expression . Parameters: name type description evaluatorType String Type of the evaluator used. Supported types: value-param , javascript . expression String Expression that depends on the evaluator type. For value-param evaluator, expression is input parameter, for javascript evaluator, it is the javascript expression. decisionCases Map[String, List[task]] Map where key is possible values that can result from expression being evaluated by evaluatorType with value being list of tasks to be executed. defaultCase List[task] List of tasks to be executed when no matching value if found in decision case (default condition) Outputs: name type description evaluationResult List[String] A List of string representing the list of cases that matched.

Switch task type is identical to how Decision tasks works except for the following differences: DECISION task type used to take two parameters 1. caseExpression : If present, this takes precedence and will be evaluated as a Javascript expression 2. caseValueParam : If caseExpression param is null or empty, case value param will be used to determine the decision branch SWITCH works with the evaluatorType and expression params as a replacement to the above. For details refer to the SWITCH task documentation Event \u00b6 Event task provides ability to publish an event (message) to either Conductor or an external eventing system like SQS. Event tasks are useful for creating event based dependencies for workflows and tasks. Parameters: name type description sink String Qualified name of the event that is produced. e.g. conductor or sqs:sqs_queue_name asyncComplete Boolean false to mark status COMPLETED upon execution ; true to keep it IN_PROGRESS, wait for an external event (via Conductor or SQS or EventHandler) to complete it. Outputs: name type description workflowInstanceId String Workflow id workflowType String Workflow Name workflowVersion Integer Workflow Version correlationId String Workflow CorrelationId sink String Copy of the input data \"sink\" asyncComplete Boolean Copy of the input data \"asyncComplete event_produced String Name of the event produced The published event's payload is identical to the output of the task (except \"event_produced\"). Example { \"sink\": \"sqs:example_sqs_queue_name\", \"asyncComplete\": false } When producing an event with Conductor as sink, the event name follows the structure: conductor:<workflow_name>:<task_reference_name> For SQS, use the name of the queue and NOT the URI. Conductor looks up the URI based on the name. Warning When using SQS add the ContribsModule to the deployment. The module needs to be configured with AWSCredentialsProvider for Conductor to be able to use AWS APIs. !!warning When using Conductor as sink, you have two options: defining the sink as conductor in which case the queue name will default to the taskReferenceName of the Event Task, or specifying the queue name in the sink, as conductor:<queue_name> . The queue name is in the event value of the event Handler, as conductor:<workflow_name>:<queue_name> . Supported Sinks Conductor SQS HTTP \u00b6 An HTTP task is used to make calls to another microservice over HTTP. Parameters: name type description http_request HttpRequest JSON object (see below) HttpRequest JSON object: name type description uri String URI for the service. Can be a partial when using vipAddress or includes the server address. method String HTTP method. One of the GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD accept String Accept header as required by server. Defaults to application/json contentType String Content Type - supported types are text/plain , text/html , and application/json (Default) headers Map[String, Any] A map of additional http headers to be sent along with the request. body Map[] Request body vipAddress String When using discovery based service URLs. asyncComplete Boolean false to mark status COMPLETED upon execution ; true to keep it IN_PROGRESS, wait for an external event (via Conductor or SQS or EventHandler) to complete it. oauthConsumerKey String OAuth client consumer key oauthConsumerSecret String OAuth client consumer secret connectionTimeOut Integer Connection Time Out in milliseconds. If set to 0, equivalent to infinity. Default: 100. readTimeOut Integer Read Time Out in milliseconds. If set to 0, equivalent to infinity. Default: 150. Output: name type description response Map JSON body containing the response if one is present headers Map[String, Any] Response Headers statusCode Integer Http Status Code reasonPhrase String Http Status Code's reason phrase Example Task Input payload using vipAddress { \"http_request\": { \"vipAddress\": \"examplevip-prod\", \"uri\": \"/\", \"method\": \"GET\", \"accept\": \"text/plain\" } } Task Input using an absolute URL { \"http_request\": { \"uri\": \"http://example.com/\", \"method\": \"GET\", \"accept\": \"text/plain\" } } The task is marked as FAILED if the request cannot be completed or the remote server returns non successful status code. Note HTTP task currently only supports Content-Type as application/json and is able to parse the text as well as JSON response. XML input/output is currently not supported. However, if the response cannot be parsed as JSON or Text, a string representation is stored as a text value. Sub Workflow \u00b6 Sub Workflow task allows for nesting a workflow within another workflow. Parameters: name type description subWorkflowParam Map[String, Any] See below subWorkflowParam name type description name String Name of the workflow to execute version Integer Version of the workflow to execute taskToDomain Map[String, String] Allows scheduling the sub workflow's tasks per given mappings. See Task Domains for instructions to configure taskDomains. workflowDefinition WorkflowDefinition Allows starting a subworkflow with a dynamic workflow definition. Outputs: name type description subWorkflowId String Subworkflow execution Id generated when running the subworkflow Example { \"name\": \"sub_workflow_task\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"sub1\", \"type\": \"SUB_WORKFLOW\", \"inputParameters\": { \"subWorkflowParam\": { \"name\": \"deployment_workflow\", \"version\": 1, \"taskToDomain\": { \"*\": \"mydomain\" }, \"workflowDefinition\": { \"name\": \"deployment_workflow\", \"description\": \"Deploys to CDN\", \"version\": 1, \"tasks\": [{ \"name\": \"deploy\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"d1\", \"type\": \"SIMPLE\", \"inputParameters\": { \"fileLocation\": \"${workflow.input.encodeLocation}\" } }], \"outputParameters\": { \"cdn_url\": \"${d1.output.location}\" }, \"failureWorkflow\": \"cleanup_encode_resources\", \"restartable\": true, \"workflowStatusListenerEnabled\": true, \"schemaVersion\": 2 } }, \"anythingelse\": \"value\" } } When executed, a deployment_workflow is executed with its inputs parameters set to the inputParameters of the sub_workflow_task and the workflow definition specified. The task is marked as completed upon the completion of the spawned workflow. If the sub-workflow is terminated or fails the task is marked as failure and retried if configured. Fork \u00b6 Fork is used to schedule parallel set of tasks, specified by \"type\":\"FORK_JOIN\" . Parameters: name description forkTasks A list of list of tasks. Each sublist is scheduled to be executed in parallel. However, tasks within the sublists are scheduled in a serial fashion. Example [ { \"name\": \"fork_join\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"forkx\", \"type\": \"FORK_JOIN\", \"forkTasks\": [ [ { \"name\": \"task_10\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"task_A\", \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" }, { \"name\": \"task_11\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"task_B\", \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" } ], [ { \"name\": \"task_21\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"task_Y\", \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" }, { \"name\": \"task_22\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"task_Z\", \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" } ] ] }, { \"name\": \"join\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"join2\", \"type\": \"JOIN\", \"joinOn\": [ \"task_B\", \"task_Z\" ] } ] When executed, task_A and task_Y are scheduled to be executed at the same time. Fork and Join A Join task MUST follow FORK_JOIN Workflow definition MUST include a Join task definition followed by FORK_JOIN task. Forked task can be a Sub Workflow, allowing for more complex execution flows. Dynamic Fork \u00b6 A dynamic fork is same as FORK_JOIN task. Except that the list of tasks to be forked is provided at runtime using task's input. Useful when number of tasks to be forked is not fixed and varies based on the input. name description dynamicForkTasksParam Name of the parameter that contains list of workflow task configuration to be executed in parallel dynamicForkTasksInputParamName Name of the parameter whose value should be a map with key as forked task's reference name and value as input the forked task Example { \"inputParameters\": { \"dynamicTasks\": \"${taskA.output.dynamicTasksJSON}\", \"dynamicTasksInput\": \"${taskA.output.dynamicTasksInputJSON}\" }, \"type\": \"FORK_JOIN_DYNAMIC\", \"dynamicForkTasksParam\": \"dynamicTasks\", \"dynamicForkTasksInputParamName\": \"dynamicTasksInput\" } Consider taskA 's output as: { \"dynamicTasksInputJSON\": { \"forkedTask1\": { \"width\": 100, \"height\": 100, \"params\": { \"recipe\": \"jpg\" } }, \"forkedTask2\": { \"width\": 200, \"height\": 200, \"params\": { \"recipe\": \"jpg\" } } }, \"dynamicTasksJSON\": [ { \"name\": \"encode_task\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"forkedTask1\", \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" }, { \"name\": \"encode_task\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"forkedTask2\", \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" } ] } When executed, the dynamic fork task will schedule two parallel task of type \"encode_task\" with reference names \"forkedTask1\" and \"forkedTask2\" and inputs as specified by _ dynamicTasksInputJSON_ Dynamic Fork and Join A Join task MUST follow FORK_JOIN_DYNAMIC Workflow definition MUST include a Join task definition followed by FORK_JOIN_DYNAMIC task. However, given the dynamic nature of the task, no joinOn parameters are required for this Join. The join will wait for ALL the forked branches to complete before completing. Unlike FORK, which can execute parallel flows with each fork executing a series of tasks in sequence, FORK_JOIN_DYNAMIC is limited to only one task per fork. However, forked task can be a Sub Workflow, allowing for more complex execution flows. Join \u00b6 Join task is used to wait for completion of one or more tasks spawned by fork tasks. Parameters: name description joinOn List of task reference name, for which the JOIN will wait for completion. Example { \"joinOn\": [\"taskRef1\", \"taskRef3\"] } Join Task Output Fork task's output will be a JSON object with key being the task reference name and value as the output of the fork task. Exclusive Join \u00b6 Exclusive Join task helps capture Task output from Decision Task's flow. For example, If we have a Workflow with T1 -> [Decision: T2/T3] -> EJ, then based on the decision, Exclusive Join (EJ) will produce the output from T2 or T3. I.e What ever is the output of one of T2/T3 will be available to downstream tasks through Exclusive Join task. If Decision Task takes True/False as cases, then: True: T1 -> T2 -> EJ; EJ will have T2's output. False: T1 -> T3 -> EJ; EJ will have T3's output. Undefined: T1 -> EJ; EJ will have T1's output. Parameters: name description joinOn List of task reference names, which the EXCLUSIVE_JOIN will lookout for to capture output. From above example, this could be [\"T2\", \"T3\"] defaultExclusiveJoinTask Task reference name, whose output should be used incase the decision case is undefined. From above example, this could be [\"T1\"] Example { \"name\": \"exclusive_join\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"exclusiveJoin\", \"type\": \"EXCLUSIVE_JOIN\", \"joinOn\": [ \"task2\", \"task3\" ], \"defaultExclusiveJoinTask\": [ \"task1\" ] } Wait \u00b6 A wait task is implemented as a gate that remains in IN_PROGRESS state unless marked as COMPLETED or FAILED by an external trigger. To use a wait task, set the task type as WAIT Parameters: None required. External Triggers for Wait Task Task Resource endpoint can be used to update the status of a task to a terminate state. Contrib module provides SQS integration where an external system can place a message in a pre-configured queue that the server listens on. As the messages arrive, they are marked as COMPLETED or FAILED . SQS Queues SQS queues used by the server to update the task status can be retrieve using the following API: GET /queue When updating the status of the task, the message needs to conform to the following spec: Message has to be a valid JSON string. The message JSON should contain a key named externalId with the value being a JSONified string that contains the following keys: workflowId : Id of the workflow taskRefName : Task reference name that should be updated. Each queue represents a specific task status and tasks are marked accordingly. e.g. message coming to a COMPLETED queue marks the task status as COMPLETED . Tasks' output is updated with the message. Example SQS Payload: { \"some_key\": \"valuex\", \"externalId\": \"{\\\"taskRefName\\\":\\\"TASK_REFERENCE_NAME\\\",\\\"workflowId\\\":\\\"WORKFLOW_ID\\\"}\" } Dynamic Task \u00b6 Dynamic Task allows to execute one of the registered Tasks dynamically at run-time. It accepts the task name to execute in inputParameters. Parameters: name description dynamicTaskNameParam Name of the parameter from the task input whose value is used to schedule the task. e.g. if the value of the parameter is ABC, the next task scheduled is of type 'ABC'. Example { \"name\": \"user_task\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"t1\", \"inputParameters\": { \"files\": \"${workflow.input.files}\", \"taskToExecute\": \"${workflow.input.user_supplied_task}\" }, \"type\": \"DYNAMIC\", \"dynamicTaskNameParam\": \"taskToExecute\" } If the workflow is started with input parameter user_supplied_task's value as user_task_2 , Conductor will schedule user_task_2 when scheduling this dynamic task. Inline Task \u00b6 Inline Task helps execute ad-hoc logic at Workflow run-time, using any evaluator engine. Supported evaluators are value-param evaluator which simply translates the input parameter to output and javascript evaluator that evaluates Javascript expression. This is particularly helpful in running simple evaluations in Conductor server, over creating Workers. Parameters: name type description notes evaluatorType String Type of the evaluator. Supported evaluators: value-param , javascript which evaluates javascript expression. expression String Expression associated with the type of evaluator. For javascript evaluator, Javascript evaluation engine is used to evaluate expression defined as a string. Must return a value. Must be non-empty. Besides expression , any value is accessible as $.value for the expression to evaluate. Outputs: name type description result Map Contains the output returned by the evaluator based on the expression The task output can then be referenced in downstream tasks like: \"${inline_test.output.result.testvalue}\" Example { \"name\": \"INLINE_TASK\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"inline_test\", \"type\": \"INLINE\", \"inputParameters\": { \"inlineValue\": \"${workflow.input.inlineValue}\", \"evaluatorType\": \"javascript\", \"expression\": \"function scriptFun(){if ($.inlineValue == 1){ return {testvalue: true} } else { return {testvalue: false} }} scriptFun();\" } } Terminate Task \u00b6 Task that can terminate a workflow with a given status and modify the workflow's output with a given parameter. It can act as a \"return\" statement for conditions where you simply want to terminate your workflow. For example, if you have a decision where the first condition is met, you want to execute some tasks, otherwise you want to finish your workflow. Parameters: name type description notes terminationStatus String can only accept \"COMPLETED\" or \"FAILED\" task cannot be optional workflowOutput Any Expected workflow output Outputs: name type description output Map The content of workflowOutput from the inputParameters. An empty object if workflowOutput is not set. { \"name\": \"terminate\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"terminate0\", \"inputParameters\": { \"terminationStatus\": \"COMPLETED\", \"workflowOutput\": \"${task0.output}\" }, \"type\": \"TERMINATE\", \"startDelay\": 0, \"optional\": false } Kafka Publish Task \u00b6 A kafka Publish task is used to push messages to another microservice via kafka Parameters: The task expects an input parameter named kafka_request as part of the task's input with the following details: name description bootStrapServers bootStrapServers for connecting to given kafka. key Key to be published keySerializer Serializer used for serializing the key published to kafka. One of the following can be set : 1. org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.IntegerSerializer 2. org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.LongSerializer 3. org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer. Default is String serializer value Value published to kafka requestTimeoutMs Request timeout while publishing to kafka. If this value is not given the value is read from the property kafka.publish.request.timeout.ms . If the property is not set the value defaults to 100 ms maxBlockMs maxBlockMs while publishing to kafka. If this value is not given the value is read from the property kafka.publish.max.block.ms . If the property is not set the value defaults to 500 ms headers A map of additional kafka headers to be sent along with the request. topic Topic to publish The producer created in the kafka task is cached. By default the cache size is 10 and expiry time is 120000 ms. To change the defaults following can be modified kafka.publish.producer.cache.size,kafka.publish.producer.cache.time.ms respectively. Kafka Task Output Task status transitions to COMPLETED Example Task sample { \"name\": \"call_kafka\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"call_kafka\", \"inputParameters\": { \"kafka_request\": { \"topic\": \"userTopic\", \"value\": \"Message to publish\", \"bootStrapServers\": \"localhost:9092\", \"headers\": { \"x-Auth\":\"Auth-key\" }, \"key\": \"123\", \"keySerializer\": \"org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.IntegerSerializer\" } }, \"type\": \"KAFKA_PUBLISH\" } The task is marked as FAILED if the message could not be published to the Kafka queue. Do While Task \u00b6 Sequentially execute a list of task as long as a condition is true. The list of tasks is executed first, before the condition is checked (even for the first iteration). When scheduled, each task of this loop will see its taskReferenceName concatenated with __i , with i being the iteration number, starting at 1. Warning: taskReferenceName containing arithmetic operators must not be used. Each task output is stored as part of the DO_WHILE task, indexed by the iteration value (see example below), allowing the condition to reference the output of a task for a specific iteration (eg. $.LoopTask['iteration]['first_task'] ) The DO_WHILE task is set to FAILED as soon as one of the loopTask fails. In such case retry, iteration starts from 1. Limitations: - Domain or isolation group execution is unsupported; - Nested DO_WHILE is unsupported; - SUB_WORKFLOW is unsupported; - Since loopover tasks will be executed in loop inside scope of parent do while task, crossing branching outside of DO_WHILE task is not respected. Branching inside loopover task is supported. Parameters: name type description loopCondition String Condition to be evaluated after every iteration. This is a Javascript expression, evaluated using the Nashorn engine. If an exception occurs during evaluation, the DO_WHILE task is set to FAILED_WITH_TERMINAL_ERROR. loopOver List[Task] List of tasks that needs to be executed as long as the condition is true. Outputs: name type description iteration Integer Iteration number: the current one while executing; the final one once the loop is finished i Map[String, Any] Iteration number as a string, mapped to the task references names and their output. * Any Any state can be stored here if the loopCondition does so. For example storage will exist if loopCondition is if ($.LoopTask['iteration'] <= 10) {$.LoopTask.storage = 3; true } else {false} Example The following definition: { \"name\": \"Loop Task\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"LoopTask\", \"type\": \"DO_WHILE\", \"inputParameters\": { \"value\": \"${workflow.input.value}\" }, \"loopCondition\": \"if ( ($.LoopTask['iteration'] < $.value ) || ( $.first_task['response']['body'] > 10)) { false; } else { true; }\", \"loopOver\": [ { \"name\": \"first task\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"first_task\", \"inputParameters\": { \"http_request\": { \"uri\": \"http://localhost:8082\", \"method\": \"POST\" } }, \"type\": \"HTTP\" },{ \"name\": \"second task\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"second_task\", \"inputParameters\": { \"http_request\": { \"uri\": \"http://localhost:8082\", \"method\": \"POST\" } }, \"type\": \"HTTP\" } ], \"startDelay\": 0, \"optional\": false } will produce the following execution, assuming 3 executions occurred (alongside first_task__1 , first_task__2 , first_task__3 , second_task__1 , second_task__2 and second_task__3 ): { \"taskType\": \"DO_WHILE\", \"outputData\": { \"iteration\": 3, \"1\": { \"first_task\": { \"response\": {}, \"headers\": { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" } }, \"second_task\": { \"response\": {}, \"headers\": { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" } } }, \"2\": { \"first_task\": { \"response\": {}, \"headers\": { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" } }, \"second_task\": { \"response\": {}, \"headers\": { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" } } }, \"3\": { \"first_task\": { \"response\": {}, \"headers\": { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" } }, \"second_task\": { \"response\": {}, \"headers\": { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" } } } } } JSON JQ Transform Task \u00b6 JSON JQ Transform task allows transforming a JSON input to another JSON structure using a query expression. Check the Jq manual , and the Jq playground for more information. Limitations: - The java implementation support most, but not all jq functions. See the lib for details. Parameters: name type description queryExpression String JQ query expression. Input is the entire inputParameters object. Outputs: name type description result Any First result returned by the jq expression resultList List[Any] List of all results returned by the jq expression error String Error, if the query throws an error. Example The following definition: { \"name\": \"jq_1\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"jq_1\", \"type\": \"JSON_JQ_TRANSFORM\", \"inputParameters\": { \"in1\": { \"arr\": [ \"a\", \"b\" ] }, \"in2\": { \"arr\": [ \"c\", \"d\" ] }, \"queryExpression\": \"{ out: (.in1.arr + .in2.arr) }\" } } will produce the following execution: { \"name\": \"jq_1\", \"type\": \"task-execution\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"jq_1\", \"taskType\": \"JSON_JQ_TRANSFORM\", \"inputData\": { \"in1\": { \"arr\": [ \"a\", \"b\" ] }, \"in2\": { \"arr\": [ \"c\", \"d\" ] }, \"queryExpression\": \"{ out: (.in1.arr + .in2.arr) }\" }, \"outputData\": { \"result\": { \"out\": [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"] }, \"resultList\": [ { \"out\": [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"] } ] } } Set Variable Task \u00b6 This task allows to set workflow variables by creating or updating them with new values. Variables can be initialized in the workflow definition as well as during the workflow run. Once a variable was initialized it can be read or overwritten with a new value by any other task. Warning There is a hard barrier for variables payload size in KB defined in the JVM system properties ( conductor.max.workflow.variables.payload.threshold.kb ) the default value is 256 .

Example: If you have 1000 task executions waiting in the queue, and 1000 workers polling this queue for tasks, but if you have set concurrentExecLimit to 10, only 10 tasks would be given to workers (which would lead to starvation). If any of the workers finishes execution, a new task(s) will be removed from the queue, while still keeping the current execution count to 10. Task Rate limits \u00b6 rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds and rateLimitPerFrequency should be used together. rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds sets the \"frequency window\", i.e the duration to be used in events per duration . Eg: 1s, 5s, 60s, 300s etc. rateLimitPerFrequency defines the number of Tasks that can be given to Workers per given \"frequency window\". Example: Let's set rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds = 5 , and rateLimitPerFrequency = 12 . This means, our frequency window is of 5 seconds duration, and for each frequency window, Conductor would only give 12 tasks to workers. So, in a given minute, Conductor would only give 12*(60/5) = 144 tasks to workers irrespective of the number of workers that are polling for the task. Note that unlike concurrentExecLimit , rate limiting doesn't take into account tasks already in progress/completed. Even if all the previous tasks are executed within 1 sec, or would take a few days, the new tasks are still given to workers at configured frequency, 144 tasks per minute in above example. Note: Rate limiting is only supported for the Redis-persistence module and is not available with other persistence layers. Using inputKeys and outputKeys \u00b6 inputKeys and outputKeys can be considered as parameters and return values for the Task. Consider the task Definition as being represented by an interface: (value1, value2 .. valueN) someTaskDefinition(key1, key2 .. keyN); However, these parameters are not strictly enforced at the moment. Both inputKeys and outputKeys act as a documentation for task re-use. The tasks in workflow need not define all of the keys in the task definition. In the future, this can be extended to be a strict template that all task implementations must adhere to, just like interfaces in programming languages. Using inputTemplate \u00b6 inputTemplate allows to define default values, which can be overridden by values provided in Workflow. Eg: In your Task Definition, you can define your inputTemplate as: \"inputTemplate\": { \"url\": \"https://some_url:7004\" } Now, in your workflow Definition, when using above task, you can use the default url or override with something else in the task's inputParameters . \"inputParameters\": { \"url\": \"${workflow.input.some_new_url}\" }","title":"Task Definition"},{"location":"configuration/taskdef/#task-definition","text":"Conductor maintains a registry of worker tasks.

Example: Let's set rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds = 5 , and rateLimitPerFrequency = 12 . This means, our frequency window is of 5 seconds duration, and for each frequency window, Conductor would only give 12 tasks to workers. So, in a given minute, Conductor would only give 12*(60/5) = 144 tasks to workers irrespective of the number of workers that are polling for the task. Note that unlike concurrentExecLimit , rate limiting doesn't take into account tasks already in progress/completed. Even if all the previous tasks are executed within 1 sec, or would take a few days, the new tasks are still given to workers at configured frequency, 144 tasks per minute in above example.

Postman or similar REST client. Creating a Workflow \u00b6 Let's create a simple workflow that adds Netflix Idents to videos. We'll be mocking the adding Idents part and focusing on actually executing this process flow. What are Netflix Idents? Netflix Idents are those 4 second videos with Netflix logo, which appears at the beginning and end of shows. Learn more about them here . You might have also noticed they're different for Animation and several other genres. Disclaimer Obviously, this is not how Netflix adds Idents. Those Workflows are indeed very complex. But, it should give you an idea about how Conductor can be used to implement similar features. The workflow in this lab will look like this: This workflow contains the following: Worker Task verify_if_idents_are_added to verify if Idents are already added. Decision Task that takes output from the previous task, and decides whether to schedule the add_idents task. add_idents task which is another worker Task. Creating Task definitions \u00b6 Let's create the task definition for verify_if_idents_are_added in JSON. This task will be a SIMPLE task which is supposed to be executed by an Idents microservice. We'll be mocking the Idents microservice part. Note that at this point, we don't have to specify whether it is a System task or Worker task. We are only specifying the required configurations for the task, like number of times it should be retried, timeouts etc. We shall start by using name parameter for task name. { \"name\": \"verify_if_idents_are_added\" } We'd like this task to be retried 3 times on failure. { \"name\": \"verify_if_idents_are_added\", \"retryCount\": 3, \"retryLogic\": \"FIXED\", \"retryDelaySeconds\": 10 } And to timeout after 300 seconds. i.e. if the task doesn't finish execution within this time limit after transitioning to IN_PROGRESS state, the Conductor server cancels this task and schedules a new execution of this task in the queue. { \"name\": \"verify_if_idents_are_added\", \"retryCount\": 3, \"retryLogic\": \"FIXED\", \"retryDelaySeconds\": 10, \"timeoutSeconds\": 300, \"timeoutPolicy\": \"TIME_OUT_WF\" } And a responseTimeout of 180 seconds. { \"name\": \"verify_if_idents_are_added\", \"retryCount\": 3, \"retryLogic\": \"FIXED\", \"retryDelaySeconds\": 10, \"timeoutSeconds\": 300, \"timeoutPolicy\": \"TIME_OUT_WF\", \"responseTimeoutSeconds\": 180 } We can define several other fields defined here , but this is a good place to start with. Similarly, create another task definition: add_idents . { \"name\": \"add_idents\", \"retryCount\": 3, \"retryLogic\": \"FIXED\", \"retryDelaySeconds\": 10, \"timeoutSeconds\": 300, \"timeoutPolicy\": \"TIME_OUT_WF\", \"responseTimeoutSeconds\": 180 } Send a POST request to /metadata/taskdefs endpoint to register these tasks. You can use Swagger, Postman, CURL or similar tools. Why is the Decision Task not registered? System Tasks that are part of control flow do not need to be registered. However, some system tasks where the retries, rate limiting and other mechanisms are required, like HTTP Task, are to be registered though. Important Task and Workflow Definition names are unique. The names we use below might have already been registered. For this lab, add a prefix with your username, {my_username}_verify_if_idents_are_added for example. This is definitely not recommended for Production usage though. Example curl -X POST \\ http://localhost:8080/api/metadata/taskdefs \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '[ { \"name\": \"verify_if_idents_are_added\", \"retryCount\": 3, \"retryLogic\": \"FIXED\", \"retryDelaySeconds\": 10, \"timeoutSeconds\": 300, \"timeoutPolicy\": \"TIME_OUT_WF\", \"responseTimeoutSeconds\": 180, \"ownerEmail\": \"type your email here\" }, { \"name\": \"add_idents\", \"retryCount\": 3, \"retryLogic\": \"FIXED\", \"retryDelaySeconds\": 10, \"timeoutSeconds\": 300, \"timeoutPolicy\": \"TIME_OUT_WF\", \"responseTimeoutSeconds\": 180, \"ownerEmail\": \"type your email here\" } ]' Creating Workflow Definition \u00b6 Creating Workflow definition is almost similar. We shall use the Task definitions created above. Note that same Task definitions can be used in multiple workflows, or for multipe times in same Workflow (that's where taskReferenceName is useful). A workflow without any tasks looks like this: { \"name\": \"add_netflix_identation\", \"description\": \"Adds Netflix Identation to video files.\", \"version\": 1, \"schemaVersion\": 2, \"tasks\": [] } Add the first task that this workflow has to execute. All the tasks must be added to the tasks array. { \"name\": \"add_netflix_identation\", \"description\": \"Adds Netflix Identation to video files.\", \"version\": 1, \"schemaVersion\": 2, \"tasks\": [ { \"name\": \"verify_if_idents_are_added\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"ident_verification\", \"inputParameters\": { \"contentId\": \"${workflow.input.contentId}\" }, \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" } ] } Wiring Input/Outputs Notice how we were using ${workflow.input.contentId} to pass inputs to this task. Conductor can wire inputs between workflow and tasks, and between tasks. i.e The task verify_if_idents_are_added is wired to accept inputs from the workflow input using JSONPath expression ${workflow.input.param} . Learn more about wiring inputs and outputs here . Let's define decisionCases now. Checkout the Decision task structure here . A Decision task is specified by type:\"DECISION\" , caseValueParam and decisionCases which lists all the branches of Decision task. This is similar to a switch..case but written in Conductor JSON DSL. Adding the decision task: { \"name\": \"add_netflix_identation\", \"description\": \"Adds Netflix Identation to video files.\", \"version\": 2, \"schemaVersion\": 2, \"tasks\": [ { \"name\": \"verify_if_idents_are_added\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"ident_verification\", \"inputParameters\": { \"contentId\": \"${workflow.input.contentId}\" }, \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" }, { \"name\": \"decide_task\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"is_idents_added\", \"inputParameters\": { \"case_value_param\": \"${ident_verification.output.is_idents_added}\" }, \"type\": \"DECISION\", \"caseValueParam\": \"case_value_param\", \"decisionCases\": { } } ] } Each decision branch could have multiple tasks, so it has to be defined as an array. { \"name\": \"add_netflix_identation\", \"description\": \"Adds Netflix Identation to video files.\", \"version\": 2, \"schemaVersion\": 2, \"tasks\": [ { \"name\": \"verify_if_idents_are_added\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"ident_verification\", \"inputParameters\": { \"contentId\": \"${workflow.input.contentId}\" }, \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" }, { \"name\": \"decide_task\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"is_idents_added\", \"inputParameters\": { \"case_value_param\": \"${ident_verification.output.is_idents_added}\" }, \"type\": \"DECISION\", \"caseValueParam\": \"case_value_param\", \"decisionCases\": { \"false\": [ { \"name\": \"add_idents\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"add_idents_by_type\", \"inputParameters\": { \"identType\": \"${workflow.input.identType}\", \"contentId\": \"${workflow.input.contentId}\" }, \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" } ] } } ] } Just like the task definitions, register this workflow definition by sending a POST request to /workflow endpoint. Example curl -X POST \\ http://localhost:8080/api/metadata/workflow \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \"name\": \"add_netflix_identation\", \"description\": \"Adds Netflix Identation to video files.\", \"version\": 2, \"schemaVersion\": 2, \"ownerEmail\": \"type your email here\", \"tasks\": [ { \"name\": \"verify_if_idents_are_added\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"ident_verification\", \"inputParameters\": { \"contentId\": \"${workflow.input.contentId}\" }, \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" }, { \"name\": \"decide_task\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"is_idents_added\", \"inputParameters\": { \"case_value_param\": \"${ident_verification.output.is_idents_added}\" }, \"type\": \"DECISION\", \"caseValueParam\": \"case_value_param\", \"decisionCases\": { \"false\": [ { \"name\": \"add_idents\", \"taskReferenceName\": \"add_idents_by_type\", \"inputParameters\": { \"identType\": \"${workflow.input.identType}\", \"contentId\": \"${workflow.input.contentId}\" }, \"type\": \"SIMPLE\" } ] } } ] }' Starting the Workflow \u00b6 Send a POST request to /workflow with: { \"name\": \"add_netflix_identation\", \"version\": 2, \"correlationId\": \"my_netflix_identation_workflows\", \"input\": { \"identType\": \"animation\", \"contentId\": \"my_unique_content_id\" } } Example: curl -X POST \\ http://localhost:8080/api/workflow/add_netflix_identation \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \"identType\": \"animation\", \"contentId\": \"my_unique_content_id\" }' Successful POST request should return a workflow Id, which you can use to find the execution in the UI. Conductor User Interface \u00b6 Open the UI and navigate to the RUNNING tab, the Workflow should be in the state as below: Feel free to explore the various functionalities that the UI exposes. To elaborate on a few: Workflow Task modals (Opens on clicking any of the tasks in the workflow), which includes task I/O, logs and task JSON. Task Details tab, which shows the sequence of task execution, status, start/end time, and link to worker details which executed the task. Input/Output tab shows workflow input and output. Poll for Worker task \u00b6 Now that verify_if_idents_are_added task is in SCHEDULED state, it is the worker's turn to fetch the task, execute it and update Conductor with final status of the task. Ideally, the workers implementing the Client interface would do this process, executing the tasks on real microservices. But, let's mock this part. Send a GET request to /poll endpoint with your task type. For example: curl -X GET \\ http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/poll/verify_if_idents_are_added Return response, add logs \u00b6 We can respond to Conductor with any of the following states: Task has COMPLETED. Task has FAILED. Call back after seconds [Process the task at a later time]. Considering our Ident Service has verified that the Ident's are not yet added to given Content Id, let's return the task status by sending the below POST request to /tasks endpoint, with payload: { \"workflowInstanceId\": \"{workflowId}\", \"taskId\": \"{taskId}\", \"reasonForIncompletion\": \"\", \"callbackAfterSeconds\": 0, \"workerId\": \"localhost\", \"status\": \"COMPLETED\", \"outputData\": { \"is_idents_added\": false } } Example: curl -X POST \\ http://localhost:8080/api/tasks \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \"workflowInstanceId\": \"cb7c5041-aa85-4940-acb4-3bdcfa9f5c5c\", \"taskId\": \"741f362b-ee9a-47b6-81b5-9bbbd5c4c992\", \"reasonForIncompletion\": \"\", \"callbackAfterSeconds\": 0, \"workerId\": \"string\", \"status\": \"COMPLETED\", \"outputData\": { \"is_idents_added\": false }, \"logs\": [ { \"log\": \"Ident verification successful for title: {some_title_name}, with Id: {some_id}\", \"createdTime\": 1550178825 } ] }' Check logs in UI You can find the logs we just sent by clicking the verify_if_idents_are_added , upon which a modal should open with Logs tab. Why is System task executed, but Worker task is Scheduled. \u00b6 You will notice that Workflow is in the state as below after sending the POST request: Conductor has executed is_idents_added all through it's lifecycle, without us polling, or returning the status of Task. If it is still unclear, is_idents_added is a System task, and System tasks are executed by Conductor Server. But, add_idents is a SIMPLE task. So, the complete lifecyle of this task (Poll, Update) should be handled by a worker to continue with W\\workflow execution. When Conductor has finished executing all the tasks in given flow, the workflow will reach Terminal state (COMPLETED, FAILED, TIMED_OUT etc.) Next steps \u00b6 You can play around this workflow by failing one of the Tasks, restarting or retrying the Workflow, or by tuning the number of retries, timeoutSeconds etc.","title":"Beginner"},{"location":"labs/beginner/#hands-on-mode","text":"Please feel free to follow along using any of these resources: Using cURL.

To enable conductor serve to publish metrics, add this dependency to your build.gradle. Conductor Server enables you to load additional modules dynamically, this feature can be controlled using this configuration . Create your own AbstractModule that overides configure function and registers the Spectator metrics registry. Initialize the Registry and add it to the global registry via ((CompositeRegistry)Spectator.globalRegistry()).add(...) . The following metrics are published by the server. You can use these metrics to configure alerts for your workflows and tasks. Name Purpose Tags workflow_server_error Rate at which server side error is happening methodName workflow_failure Counter for failing workflows workflowName, status workflow_start_error Counter for failing to start a workflow workflowName workflow_running Counter for no. of running workflows workflowName, version workflow_execution Timer for Workflow completion workflowName, ownerApp task_queue_wait Time spent by a task in queue taskType task_execution Time taken to execute a task taskType, includeRetries, status task_poll Time taken to poll for a task taskType task_poll_count Counter for number of times the task is being polled taskType, domain task_queue_depth Pending tasks queue depth taskType, ownerApp task_rate_limited Current number of tasks being rate limited taskType task_concurrent_execution_limited Current number of tasks being limited by concurrent execution limit taskType task_timeout Counter for timed out tasks taskType task_response_timeout Counter for tasks timedout due to responseTimeout taskType task_update_conflict Counter for task update conflicts.

Log4j supports various appenders that can print metrics into a console/file or even send them to remote metrics collectors over e.g. syslog channel. Conductor provides optional modules that connect metrics registry with the logging framework. To enable these modules, configure following additional modules property in config.properties: conductor.metrics-logger.enabled = true conductor.metrics-logger.reportPeriodSeconds = 15 This will push all available metrics into log4j every 15 seconds. By default, the metrics will be handled as a regular log message (just printed to console with default log4j.properties). In order to change that, you can use following log4j configuration that prints metrics into a dedicated file: log4j.rootLogger=INFO,console,file log4j.appender.console=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender log4j.appender.console.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout log4j.appender.console.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %5p [%t] (%C) - %m%n log4j.appender.file=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender log4j.appender.file.File=/app/logs/conductor.log log4j.appender.file.MaxFileSize=10MB log4j.appender.file.MaxBackupIndex=10 log4j.appender.file.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout log4j.appender.file.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %5p [%t] (%C) - %m%n # Dedicated file appender for metrics log4j.appender.fileMetrics=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender log4j.appender.fileMetrics.File=/app/logs/metrics.log log4j.appender.fileMetrics.MaxFileSize=10MB log4j.appender.fileMetrics.MaxBackupIndex=10 log4j.appender.fileMetrics.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout log4j.appender.fileMetrics.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %5p [%t] (%C) - %m%n log4j.logger.ConductorMetrics=INFO,console,fileMetrics log4j.additivity.ConductorMetrics=false This configuration is bundled with conductor-server in file: log4j-file-appender.properties and can be utilized by setting env var: LOG4J_PROP=log4j-file-appender.properties This variable is used by startup.sh script. Integration with logstash using a log file \u00b6 The metrics collected by log4j can be further processed and pushed into a central collector such as ElasticSearch. One way of achieving this is to use: log4j file appender -> logstash -> ElasticSearch. Considering the above setup, you can deploy logstash to consume the contents of /app/logs/metrics.log file, process it and send further to elasticsearch.
