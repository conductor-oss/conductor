This feature constitutes a server-side gRPC implementation along with protobuf RPC schemas for the workflow, metadata and task APIs that can be run concurrently with the Jersey-based HTTP/REST server. The protobuf models for all the types are exposed through the API. gRPC java clients for the workflow, metadata and task APIs are also available for use. Another valuable addition is an idiomatic Go gRPC client implementation for the worker API. The proto models are auto-generated at compile time using this ProtoGen library. This custom library adds messageInput and messageOutput fields to all proto tasks and task definitions. The goal of these fields is providing a type-safe way to pass input and input metadata through tasks that use the gRPC API. These fields use the Any protobuf type which can store any arbitrary message type in a type-safe way, without the server needing to know the exact serialization format of the message. In order to expose these Any objects in the REST API, a custom encoding is used that contains the raw data of the serialized message by converting it into a dictionary with '@type' and '@value' keys, where '@type' is identical to the canonical representation and '@value' contains a base64 encoded string with the binary data of the serialized message.

Currently, only AWS S3 is supported as a storage system, however, as with all other Conductor components, this is pluggable and can be extended to enable any other object store to be used as an external payload storage system. The externalization of payloads is enforced using two kinds of barriers. Soft barriers are used when the  payload size is warranted enough to be stored as part of workflow execution. These payloads will be stored in external storage and used during execution. Hard barriers are enforced to safeguard against voluminous data, and such payloads are rejected and the workflow execution is failed. The payload size is evaluated in the client before being sent over the wire to the server. If the payload size exceeds the configured soft limit, the client makes a request to the server for the location at which the payload is to be stored. In this case where S3 is being used, the server returns a signed url for the location and the client uploads the payload using this signed url. The relative path to the payload object is then stored in the workflow/task metadata. The server can then download this payload from this path and use as needed during execution. This allows the server to control access to the S3 bucket, thereby making the user applications where the worker processes are run completely agnostic of the permissions needed to access this location.</p>"},{"location":"devguide/architecture/technicaldetails.html#dynamic-workflow-executions","title":"Dynamic Workflow Executions","text":"<p>In the earlier version (v1.x), Conductor allowed the execution of workflows referencing the workflow and task definitions stored as metadata in the system.

You can modify the Docker Compose to skip using Elasticsearch if you have no option to run this with your memory options.  Refer to Disabling Elasticsearch for more information. Elasticsearch fails to come up in arm64-based CPU machines Elasticsearch v6.8.x does not have an arm64-based Docker image. Make sure you are using Elasticsearch v7 and later. Server times out at start up because Elasticsearch remains in Yellow health By default, the Conductor server requires Elasticsearch to be in Green state so that it can run when indexing is enabled. To work around this, use one of the following solutions: <ul><li>Set the following property <code>conductor.elasticsearch.clusterHealthColor=yellow</code> in <code>config-*.properties</code> files.</li> <li>Spin up another cluster (more than one node) to prevent the timeout</li></ul> Refer to the GitHub issue. Changes in <code>config-*.properties</code> files are not taking effect The configuration files are copied into the Docker image when it is built. For the changes to take effect, you must rebuild the image.  For best practices, you can mount the configuration files as a Docker volume instead to reflect the new changes automatically without rebuilding.

The workflow is deployed and working fine, which means there are T2 workers polling and executing. If you modify T2 and run it locally there is no guarantee that your modified T2 worker will get the task that you are looking for as it coming from the general T2 queue. \"Task Domain\" feature solves this problem by splitting the T2 queue by domains, so when the app polls for task T2 in a specific domain, it get the correct task.</p> <p>When starting a workflow multiple domains can be specified as a fall backs, for example \"domain1,domain2\". Conductor keeps track of last polling time for each task, so in this case it checks if the there are any active workers (workers polled at least once in a 10 second window) for \"domain1\" then the task is put in \"domain1\", if not then the same check is done for the next domain in sequence \"domain2\" and so on.</p> <p>If no workers are active for the domains provided:</p> <ul> <li>If <code>NO_DOMAIN</code> is provided as last token in list of domains, then no domain is set.</li> <li>Else, task will be added to last inactive domain in list of domains, hoping that workers would soon be available for that domain.</li> </ul> <p>Also, a <code>*</code> token can be used to apply domains for all tasks. This can be overridden by providing task specific mappings along with <code>*</code>. </p> <p>For example, the below configuration:</p> <pre><code>\"taskToDomain\": {\n  \"*\": \"mydomain\",\n  \"some_task_x\":\"NO_DOMAIN\",\n  \"some_task_y\": \"someDomain, NO_DOMAIN\",\n  \"some_task_z\": \"someInactiveDomain1, someInactiveDomain2\"\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>puts <code>some_task_x</code> in default queue (no domain).</li> <li>puts <code>some_task_y</code> in <code>someDomain</code> domain, if available or in default otherwise.</li> <li>puts <code>some_task_z</code> in <code>someInactiveDomain2</code>, even though workers are not available yet.</li> <li>and puts all other tasks in <code>mydomain</code> (even if workers are not available).</li> </ul> <p>Note that this \"fall back\" type domain strings can only be used when starting the workflow, when polling from the client only one domain is used.

There are often different ways you can implement a feature. Getting some discussion about different options helps shape the best solution. When starting directly with a Pull Request, there is the risk of having to make considerable changes. Sometimes that is the best approach, though! Showing an idea with code can be very helpful; be aware that it might be throw-away work. Some of our best Pull Requests came out of multiple competing implementations, which helped shape it to perfection.</p> <p>Also, consider that not every feature is a good fit for Conductor. A few things to consider are:</p> <ul> <li>Is it increasing complexity for the user, or might it be confusing?</li> <li>Does it, in any way, break backward compatibility (this is seldom acceptable)</li> <li>Does it require new dependencies (this is rarely acceptable for core modules)</li> <li>Should the feature be opt-in or enabled by default. For integration with a new Queuing recipe or persistence module, a separate module which can be optionally enabled is the right choice.  </li> <li>Should the feature be implemented in the main Conductor repository, or would it be better to set up a separate repository? Especially for integration with other systems, a separate repository is often the right choice because the life-cycle of it will be different.</li> </ul> <p>Of course, for more minor bug fixes and improvements, the process can be more light-weight.</p> <p>We'll try to be responsive to Pull Requests.
