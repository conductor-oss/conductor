# Conductor Docker Builds

## Pre-built docker images

Conductor server with support for the following backend:
1. Redis
2. Postgres
3. Mysql
4. Cassandra

### Docker File for Server and UI

[Docker Image Source for Server with UI](server/Dockerfile)

### Configuration Guide for Conductor Server
Conductor uses a persistent store for managing state.  
The choice of backend is quite flexible and can be configured at runtime using `conductor.db.type` property.

Refer to the table below for various supported backend and required configurations to enable each of them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> See [config.properties](docker/server/config/config.properties) for the required properties for each of the backends.
>
> | Backend    | Property                           |
> |------------|------------------------------------|
> | postgres   | conductor.db.type=postgres         |
> | redis      | conductor.db.type=redis_standalone |
> | mysql      | conductor.db.type=mysql            |
> | cassandra  | conductor.db.type=cassandra        |

Conductor using Elasticsearch for indexing the workflow data.  
Currently, Elasticsearch 6 and 7 are supported.

We welcome community contributions for other indexing backends.

**Note:** Docker images use Elasticsearch 7.

## Helm Charts

## Run Docker Compose Locally
### Use the docker-compose to bring up the local conductor server.

| Docker Compose                                               | Description                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml)                   | Redis + Elasticsearch 7    |
| [docker-compose-postgres.yaml](docker-compose-postgres.yaml) | Postgres + Elasticsearch 7 |
| [docker-compose-mysql.yaml](docker-compose-mysql.yaml)    | Mysql + Elasticsearch 7    |

### Network errors during UI build with yarn

It has been observed, that the UI build may fail with an error message like

```
> [linux/arm64 ui-builder 5/7] RUN yarn install && cp -r node_modules/monaco-editor public/ && yarn build:
269.9     at Object.onceWrapper (node:events:633:28)

```

This does not necessarily mean, that the network is unavailable, but can be caused by too high latency, as well. `yarn` accepts the option `--network-timeout <#ms>` to set a custom timeout in milliseconds.

For passing arguments to `yarn`, in [this Dockerfile](server/Dockerfile) the _optional_ build arg `YARN_OPTS` has been added. This argument will be added to each `yarn` call.

When using one of the `docker-compose-*` files, you can set this via the environment variable `YARN_OPTS`, e.g.:

```
YARN_OPTS='--network-timeout 10000000' docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
```

When building a Docker image using `docker`, you must call it like e.g.

```
docker build --build-arg='YARN_OPTS=--network-timeout 10000000' .. -f server/Dockerfile -t oss-conductor:v3.21.9
```
