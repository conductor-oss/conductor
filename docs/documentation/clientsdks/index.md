# Client SDKs
Conductor tasks that are executed by remote workers communicate over HTTP endpoints/gRPC to poll for the task and update the status of the execution. The follow SDKs are provided for implementing Conductor workers.

* [Java](java-sdk.md)
* [Clojure](clojure-sdk.md)
* [C#](csharp-sdk.md)
* [Go](go-sdk.md)
* [Python](python-sdk.md)
* [Javascript/Typescript](js-sdk.md)

The non-Java Conductor SDKs are hosted on a separate GitHub repository: [github.com/conductor-sdk](https://github.com/conductor-sdk).  Contributions from the community are encouraged!
