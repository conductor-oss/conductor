# Task Definition

Task Definitions are used to register SIMPLE tasks (workers). Conductor maintains a registry of user task types. A task type MUST be registered before being used in a workflow.

This should not be confused with [*Task Configurations*](./workflowdef/index.md#task-configurations) which are part of the Workflow Definition, and are iterated in the `tasks` property in the definition.

### Retry Logic

* FIXED: Reschedule the task after `retryDelaySeconds`
* EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF: Reschedule the task after `retryDelaySeconds * (2 ^ attemptNumber)`
* LINEAR_BACKOFF: Reschedule after `retryDelaySeconds * backoffRate * attemptNumber`
 
### Timeout Policy

* RETRY: Retries the task again
* TIME_OUT_WF: Workflow is marked as TIMED_OUT and terminated. This is the default value.
* ALERT_ONLY: Registers a counter (task_timeout)

### Task Concurrent Execution Limits

`concurrentExecLimit` limits the number of simultaneous Task executions at any point.

**Example** 
You have 1000 task executions waiting in the queue, and 1000 workers polling this queue for tasks, but if you have set `concurrentExecLimit` to 10, only 10 tasks would be given to workers (which would lead to starvation). If any of the workers finishes execution, a new task(s) will be removed from the queue, while still keeping the current execution count to 10.

### Task Rate Limits

!!! note "Rate Limiting"
    Rate limiting is only supported for the Redis-persistence module and is not available with other persistence layers.

* `rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds` and `rateLimitPerFrequency` should be used together.
* `rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds` sets the "frequency window", i.e the `duration` to be used in `events per duration`. Eg: 1s, 5s, 60s, 300s etc.
* `rateLimitPerFrequency`defines the number of Tasks that can be given to Workers per given "frequency window". No rate limit if set to 0.

**Example**  
Let's set `rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds = 5`, and `rateLimitPerFrequency = 12`. This means our frequency window is of 5 seconds duration, and for each frequency window, Conductor would only give 12 tasks to workers. So, in a given minute, Conductor would only give 12*(60/5) = 144 tasks to workers irrespective of the number of workers that are polling for the task.  

Note that unlike `concurrentExecLimit`, rate limiting doesn't take into account tasks already in progress or a terminal state. Even if all the previous tasks are executed within 1 sec, or would take a few days, the new tasks are still given to workers at configured frequency, 144 tasks per minute in above example.   


### Using `inputKeys` and `outputKeys`

* `inputKeys` and `outputKeys` can be considered as parameters and return values for the Task.
* Consider the task Definition as being represented by an interface: ```(value1, value2 .. valueN) someTaskDefinition(key1, key2 .. keyN);```.
* However, these parameters are not strictly enforced at the moment. Both `inputKeys` and `outputKeys` act as a documentation for task re-use. The tasks in workflow need not define all of the keys in the task definition.
* In the future, this can be extended to be a strict template that all task implementations must adhere to, just like interfaces in programming languages.

### Using `inputTemplate`

* `inputTemplate` allows to define default values, which can be overridden by values provided in Workflow.
* Eg: In your Task Definition, you can define your inputTemplate as:

```json
"inputTemplate": {
    "url": "https://some_url:7004"
}
```

* Now, in your workflow Definition, when using above task, you can use the default `url` or override with something else in the task's `inputParameters`.

```json
"inputParameters": {
    "url": "${workflow.input.some_new_url}"
}
```
